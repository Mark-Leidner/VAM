      SUBROUTINE MD2UV(MAG,DEG,UCOMP,VCOMP)
C     THIS SUBROUTINE IS USED IN THE SEASAT STREAMLINE PROGRAM TO
C     CALCULATE THE U,V COMPONENTS OF THE WIND,GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE
C     AND DIRECTION.DIRECTION IS TAKEN AS 0 DEGREES-NORTH, 90-EAST,
C     180-SOUTH AND 270-WEST.THE VARIABLE CONVRT IS USED TO CONVERT
C     THE DIRECTION (PASSED IN AS DEGREES) TO RADIANS.
C     THE CONVENTION FOR THE COMPONENTS IS AS FOLLOWS:NORTH-EAST QUAD.
C     U-NEG,V-NEG:SOUTH-EAST QUAD.U-NEG,V-POS:SOUTH-WEST QUAD.U-POS
C     V-POS:NORTH-WEST QUAD.U-POS,V-NEG
C
      DATA CONVRT/57.29578/
      REAL MAG
C
      VCOMP=(-COS(DEG/CONVRT)) * MAG
      UCOMP=(-SIN(DEG/CONVRT)) * MAG

      RETURN
      END
