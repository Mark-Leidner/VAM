This directory contains all f90 code for the VAM99 main routines,
which includes all codes except the pre- and postprocessing routines.

The following named revisions have been created:

Build1: Version that uses linked list for observation data,
  implemented for conventional data only, tested with 1obs case of the
  initial revision.

Build2: Working version with support for conventional and ambigous
   winds.  Tested on canned CONV and NSCAT.25km.winds cases, and on
   NSCAT and QUIKSCAT (HDF) winds.

Build3: Updated vam_obs data file structure, revised gridops and vamobs namelists
   some reorganization of modules, other stylistic changes.
   Tested against Build2.

Build4: Gridded file header changed to ASCII format, removed dependence on native
   format codes.  Added support for sigma0 obs data.  Tested against
   canned NSCAT.25km.sigma0 and  NSCAT.50km.sigma0 cases, and on
   Quikscat (HDF) Level 2A data.
