These program require a version 4.0 release 2 of HDF, and its given
libraries.

The software has been tested on SGI and SUN Solaris.  If you are using 
any other operating system, please use at your own risk.

Please check the ftp site for updated software and makefile versions:

To Come: 
	Makefile for HP
        Makefile for SUN OS

	Straight HDF readers (without need to use the nscatshell.a 
	library both in C and FORTRAN.

# READ: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#####################################################################

1.	You must have a version 4.0 release 2 of HDF installed in
	a known directory in order to be able to run this programs

	You need to be able to run ansi C

2.	This directory contains the following:

        	file		README
		file		Makefile
		directory	hdfshell
		directory	readers
		directory	dumpers

3.	This Makefile is the top makefile.  You need to edit this file 
	and follow the directions to change the path for the following 
	directories:

   		HDFDIR			(change this path)
   		HDFINC			(change this path)

	HDFDIR and HDFINC need to reflect your own HDF environment.  


4.	In order to compile and be able to use these functions type
	the following:
 
		make -f Makefile.###

        where ### can be sgi or sun depending on whether you are
        compiling on an sgi or a solaris 

5.	If you have installed the correct version of HDF, and you
	have followed the directions typing the above commmand
        will compile all the programs on this tree.

6. 	You would not need to change the individual Makefiles of
	each subdirectory, all you need to change is the Makefile
        in this directory. 

7.	The readers expect to have the nscatshell.a library
        this one will be created when you succesfully execute
 	the above command.  This library is located in
	./hdfshell/lib

8.	The Makefiles in each of the subdirectories expect that
	you compile succesfully this top Makefile.

9.	If you would like to compile each file or each subdirectory
	separetely you will need to write your own makefiles to
        do so.

10.	Remember to clean you directories by:

		make -f Makefile.### clean
